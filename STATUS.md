# Implementation Status

## Milestone 1: host ICD lifecycle

Implemented:

- All 165 Vulkan 1.0/1.1 core entrypoints are exported and present in the ICD
  proc tables. Promoted KHR aliases are available for the advertised instance
  extensions.
- Loader magic and dispatchable-object initialization for instances, physical
  devices, devices, queues, and command buffers.
- Instance/device/queue lifecycle, device groups, Vulkan 1.1 input/output
  `pNext` chains, external-capability rejection, and protected/sparse rejection.
- OpenAGC-backed GPU-visible memory, buffers and images, plus host-side views,
  synchronization, command pools, command buffers, queries, descriptors,
  render-pass/framebuffer objects, and valid pipeline-cache serialization.
- Thread-safe allocation-count enforcement, custom-allocation failure cleanup,
  and concurrent lifecycle coverage.
- Loader and Validation Layer tests. The VVL callback treats both warnings and
  errors as test failures.
- The ICD links OpenAGC transitively and consumes its versioned gfx1013
  capability snapshot instead of duplicating memory, format, sample-count,
  image-dimension, Wave32, MRT, and compute-limit definitions.

Capability evidence:

- OpenAGC's FW 5.50 qualification records establish the exposed R8/RG8/RGBA8,
  BGRA8, RGB10A2, R11G11B10, R/RG/RGBA 16/32-bit float, sRGB, D16, D32, S8,
  D16+S8, and D32+S8 format families.
- OpenAGC bounds image dimensions at 16,384 and color targets at eight.
- OpenAGC's verified PS5 memory profiles use a 4 GB write-back/onion range with
  4 KB alignment and a 12 GB write-combined/garlic range with 2 MB alignment.
- Remaining shader-stage limits use conservative gfx10/RADV bounds and do not
  enable the corresponding optional Vulkan features before shader qualification.

## Milestone 2: runtime shader pipelines

Implemented:

- Runtime VS/PS/CS/GS/tessellation compilation through the reusable
  `libopenagc_psbc` C API.
- Pipeline-context translation for vertex input, descriptor-set layouts,
  push-constant ranges, fragment specialization constants, entry points, and
  render-pass color attachment counts.
- Correct fused-stage selection for VS+GS, VS+TCS, TES NGG, and TES+GS, with
  independent Vulkan specialization maps for the primary and pre-stage SPIR-V.
- Owned AGC records and compiler metadata live with the Vulkan pipeline and are
  released deterministically by `vkDestroyPipeline`.
- A host end-to-end test compiles graphics and compute pipelines alongside the
  loader/Validation Layer test suite. The compiler's direct tests also cover
  concurrent API use.
- Host and Prospero compiler archives are selectable with
  `OPENAGC_PSBC_LIBRARY`; the installed SDK packages the selected archive and
  header transitively.

Deliberately unavailable before later milestones:

- Geometry and tessellation feature advertisement before repeated hardware
  qualification.
- Sparse and protected resources, external handles, multiview, YCbCr conversion,
  timeline semaphores, descriptor indexing, and VideoOut WSI.

## Milestone 3: OpenAGC command emission (in progress)

Implemented and host-verified:

- Pipeline creation relocates compiler offset-based records through OpenAGC,
  uploads executable code to 256-byte-aligned storage, and fuses NGG
  front/back records with `sceAgcFuseShaderHalves_0200`.
- Command buffers own resettable 64 KiB OpenAGC DCBs. Compute bind/dispatch
  emits gfx1013 compute state and `DISPATCH_DIRECT` with the compiler's resolved
  post-specialization local size.
- Descriptor pools own deterministic GPU-visible table storage. Standard
  storage/uniform-buffer descriptor writes and copies remain logical Vulkan
  state until dispatch, where the ICD encodes gfx1013 buffer descriptors,
  flushes the table, and asks OpenAGC to patch compiler descriptor-set
  placeholders immediately before `DISPATCH_DIRECT`. Missing sets and
  unsupported user-SGPR kinds fail command-buffer finalization.
- No-input VS/PS triangle bind/draw emits the fused Wave32 NGG state,
  interpolant state, base-vertex/start-instance user SGPRs, and
  `DRAW_INDEX_AUTO` through `agcGfx1013DrawBaselineIndexAuto`.
- The command-recording regression compiles ordinary SPIR-V compute and
  triangle shaders and verifies the real PM4 opcodes and dispatch/draw counts.

Hardware gate still open:

- Shader executable uploads and queue submission storage now use OpenAGC
  flexible GPU-visible allocations. `vkQueueSubmit` copies each recorded DCB
  into the serialized queue mapping, appends a monotonic EOP `RELEASE_MEM`,
  submits through OpenAGC, and performs a bounded label wait before signaling
  Vulkan semaphores and fences. The host backend captures and verifies the
  submitted packet, including the appended release.
- Vulkan memory type 0 uses flexible write-back GPU memory; type 1 uses
  2 MiB-aligned write-combined direct memory. Mapping, flush, invalidate, and
  destruction delegate to OpenAGC and preserve the advertised heap semantics.
- Image/sampler descriptor tables, dynamic buffer offsets, vertex-buffer
  tables, push constants, render-target frame prologues, and render-pass
  attachment state are not emitted yet.
- FW 5.50 execution and deterministic readback/display evidence have not yet
  been collected for the Vulkan-owned submission path.
